🧠 Model Architecture
Input: 20 time-step sequences of past magnitudes

Model:

LSTM layer (50 units)

Dense output layer (1 unit)

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error

Optimizer: Adam

📈 Output Insights
Visualization: Comparison between predicted and actual seismic magnitudes

Excel Export: seismic_forecast_lstm.xlsx for offline analysis or dashboard integration
